# DigiLog — Business Context

**Last updated:** 2026-03-05

---

## 1. What is DigiLog?

DigiLog is a **21 CFR Part 11 compliant digital logbook** designed for regulated industries — pharmaceutical, biotechnology, food manufacturing, and medical device companies. It replaces paper-based logbooks, equipment records, and manual tracking systems with a secure, auditable, and configurable digital platform.

The name "DigiLog" combines "Digital" and "Logbook" — reflecting its core purpose of digitizing the record-keeping processes that regulated facilities must maintain for compliance.

---

## 2. The Problem

### Paper-Based Record Keeping

Regulated manufacturing facilities are required by law (FDA 21 CFR Part 11, EU Annex 11, GMP) to maintain detailed records of:
- Equipment status, maintenance, and calibration
- Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, pressure)
- Personnel actions and approvals
- Material tracking and chain of custody
- Process deviations and corrective actions

**Current pain points with paper systems:**

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Paper logbooks are easily lost, damaged, or tampered with | Compliance risk, data integrity failures |
| Manual entries are illegible, inconsistent, or incomplete | Quality issues, audit findings |
| No real-time visibility into equipment or facility status | Delayed response to critical issues |
| Audit preparation requires weeks of manual document gathering | High labor cost, production downtime |
| No automated alerts when parameters go out of range | Product quality and safety risks |
| Difficult to enforce who can do what | Authorization gaps, compliance violations |
| No proof that records haven't been altered after the fact | Data integrity concerns (ALCOA+ principles) |

### Regulatory Pressure

The FDA's 21 CFR Part 11 regulation establishes requirements for electronic records and electronic signatures. Non-compliance can result in:
- **Warning letters** and consent decrees
- **Import alerts** blocking product entry into the US market
- **Product recalls** due to data integrity concerns
- **Criminal prosecution** in severe cases of data fraud

Many companies avoid digital systems because they fear the complexity of achieving Part 11 compliance. DigiLog removes this barrier by building compliance into the architecture.

---

## 3. The Solution

DigiLog provides a **template-driven entity management system** where:

1. **Administrators define templates** — blueprints for equipment types (e.g., "Reactor Vessel", "Clean Room", "HVAC Unit") with:
   - Typed attributes (serial number, capacity, temperature range)
   - Telemetry point definitions (real-time sensor data structure)
   - Inspection checklists (14 question types for structured verification)
   - Alarm rules (out-of-range detection)
   - Status lifecycle (Active → Under Maintenance → Decommissioned)
   - Connection rules (how many parent/child links allowed)

2. **Operators create entities from templates** — individual equipment/room/building instances organized in a hierarchical tree:
   - Enterprise → Site → Building → Floor → Room → Equipment
   - Each entity inherits its template's schema for consistent data capture

3. **Everything is audited** — every create, update, delete, status change, and relationship modification generates a tamper-evident audit record with SHA-256 checksums

4. **Access is controlled** — role-based permissions determine who can view, create, modify, or delete entities, with configurable re-authentication for sensitive operations

## 6. Core Features — Business Perspective

### 6.1 Entity Management

**Business need:** Track every piece of equipment, room, and facility component with structured, validated data.

**What it does:**
- Define entity templates (blueprints) with typed attributes, inspection checklists, alarm thresholds, and status lifecycles
- Create entity instances from templates, organized in a hierarchical tree
- Link entities with 12 relationship types (Contains, Feeds, Monitors, Depends On, etc.)
- Attach physical identifiers (QR codes, barcodes, RFID, NFC tags)
- Track status transitions (Active → Under Maintenance → Decommissioned)
- Enforce connection limits (e.g., a sensor can only have 1 parent equipment)
- Version-controlled templates — every update creates a snapshot for traceability

**14 Checklist Question Types:**
| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| PASS_FAIL | Equipment inspection pass/fail with criteria |
| YES_NO | Binary compliance check |
| YES_NO_NA | Compliance check with "not applicable" option |
| MCQ | Single-choice from predefined options |
| MULTI_SELECT | Multiple-choice selection |
| TEXT | Free-text observation or note |
| NUMERIC | Measured value with unit and min/max range |
| DROPDOWN | Selection from a list |
| PHOTO | Visual evidence capture |
| DATE_TIME | Date/time recording |
| SIGNATURE | Supervisor or operator sign-off |
| YES_NO_COMMENT | Yes/No with mandatory comment |
| CALCULATED | Auto-computed from formula |
| CONDITIONAL | Shows only when a condition is met |

### 6.2 User Management

**Business need:** Control who can access the system and what they can do, with full accountability.

**What it does:**
- Create/edit/delete user accounts with role assignment
- 6 default roles with configurable permissions (21 permissions across 7 categories)
- Create custom roles for specialized access patterns
- Enforce password policies (complexity, history, expiry)
- Account lockout after failed login attempts
- Forced password change on first login (temporary passwords)
- Admin-initiated password reset workflow
- Bulk user operations for large deployments

### 6.3 Audit Trail

**Business need:** Prove that records are authentic, unmodified, and attributable — the foundation of 21 CFR Part 11.

**What it does:**
- Every mutation (create, update, delete, status change) generates an audit record
- Records include: who (user), what (action), when (timestamp), before/after values, IP address
- SHA-256 checksum on each record — any modification is detectable
- Integrity verification on every read (recomputes checksum)
- Searchable and filterable by date range, user, action type, target entity
- Customizable audit message templates per action type
- SUPER_ADMIN actions exempt from logging (21 CFR Part 11 provision)

### 6.4 Configuration

**Business need:** Adapt the system to each facility's policies without developer involvement.

**33 configuration endpoints** covering:

| Category | Settings |
|----------|----------|
| **Security** | Password policy (length, complexity, history, expiry), login security (lockout rules), session management (duration, idle timeout) |
| **Display** | DateTime format, pagination options, field labels, branding (logo, colors, company name) |
| **Access** | Role privileges, sidebar visibility per role/user, action re-authentication matrix |
| **Audit** | Customizable audit message templates with placeholder system |
| **User ID** | Auto-generation format (prefix, separator, sequence) |

### 6.5 Notifications

**Business need:** Keep users informed of relevant events without information overload.

**What it does:**
- Role-based notification delivery (supervisors see team events, admins see system events)
- Unread count badge in header
- Mark read/unread, bulk operations
- In-app toast notifications for real-time feedback (relationship created, entity deleted, etc.)

### 6.6 Backup & Restore

**Business need:** Protect against data loss and support disaster recovery plans.

**What it does:**
- Full database export as downloadable ZIP
- Restore from backup with validation
- Backup integrity verification before restore

### 6.7 Data Ingestion & IoT Integration

**Business need:** Capture real-time sensor data from equipment automatically, replacing manual readings and enabling continuous monitoring.

**What it does:**
- **MQTT transport** — devices publish telemetry via standard MQTT protocol (EMQX broker)
- **HTTP transport** — REST API for telemetry data submission
- **WebSocket** — Real-time bidirectional streaming for dashboards
- **Processing pipeline** — 11-stage BullMQ pipeline: validation, enrichment, transformation, persistence, rule evaluation, alarm check, notification dispatch, aggregation, forwarding, DLQ, tracing
- **TimescaleDB** — Time-series database with 5 hypertables for efficient telemetry storage and queries
- **Dead Letter Queue** — Failed messages captured for analysis and replay

### 6.8 Rule Chain Engine

**Business need:** Automate decision-making based on incoming data — trigger alarms, transform values, route data, without custom code.

**What it does:**
- **28 node types** — filter, transform, switch, delay, aggregate, enrichment, action, external integration
- **Visual editor** — React Flow-based drag-and-drop rule chain builder
- **Sandboxed execution** — User scripts run in secure VM contexts (no access to system resources)
- **Sub-chain delegation** — Rule chains can call other chains for modular automation
- **Automatic alarm management** — Each alarm rule creates both create-alarm and clear-alarm paths

### 6.9 Alarm Management

**Business need:** Detect and alert when equipment parameters go out of range, with auditable acknowledgment and clearance workflows.

**What it does:**
- **4 alarm statuses** — ACTIVE, ACKNOWLEDGED, CLEARED, MANUALLY_CLEARED
- **3 severity levels** — WARNING, ALARM, CRITICAL
- **Role-based column visibility** — Admins control which alarm columns each role can see
- **Reauth-protected actions** — Alarm acknowledgment and clearance require re-authentication
- **Audit logged** — All alarm actions generate audit trail entries
- **Enriched display** — Alarm list includes entity names, threshold values, and generated/cleared values

### 6.10 Unified Namespace (UNS)

**Business need:** Organize all data sources in a standardized ISA-95 hierarchy for consistent cross-system data access.

**What it does:**
- **ISA-95 paths** — Enterprise/Site/Area/Line/Cell path structure
- **Auto-mapping** — Automatically generates UNS paths from entity hierarchy
- **Wildcard search** — Path-based queries for namespace traversal
- **Cascade moves** — Moving a node cascades to all descendants

**Effective:** 2026-02-25 (v2.1.1) | **Updated:** 2026-03-05 (v3.0.0)

### Why This Matters for Regulated Industries

In 21 CFR Part 11 environments, **documentation integrity is as critical as system integrity**. Regulatory audits assess not just whether systems work correctly, but whether changes are properly documented, traceable, and governed.

### Governance Controls Activated

| Control | Business Benefit |
|---------|-----------------|
| Auto-synchronized documentation (7 files) | Audit readiness — documentation always matches system state |
| Structured bug lifecycle (Git issues + Bug_Resolution_Log) | Traceability — every defect has root cause analysis and resolution record |
| Centralized testing documentation | Organized evidence for validation audits (IQ/OQ/PQ) |
| Version-tracked governance documents | Change control compliance — every modification is logged |
| Mandatory documentation update on every change | Eliminates documentation drift — a common FDA audit finding |

### Git Issue Lifecycle (v2.1.2)

All 12 historical bugs have been converted to structured GitHub issues (#2–#13) with full traceability:
- **11 issues closed** with linked commit references
- **1 issue open** (#13 — low priority test expectation mismatch)
- Each issue includes: module, severity, root cause analysis, impact, resolution
- Bug_Resolution_Log.md links each bug entry to its GitHub issue

### Risk Reduction

- **Eliminates documentation lag** — the #1 cause of 483 observations related to electronic records
- **Ensures traceability** — every code change maps to documentation changes
- **Full bug traceability** — Bug_Resolution_Log → Git Issue → Commit → Documentation
- **Supports audit preparation** — structured documents reduce audit preparation from weeks to hours
- **Maintains system validated state** — documentation always reflects current validated configuration
