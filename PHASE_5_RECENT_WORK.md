# Phase 5 — Reports, Offline Hardening, RFID SDK, Filter Data Console (April 15–29, 2026)

This doc captures the architecture and behavior changes that landed **after** the Phase 4 release (`2.3.0`, 2026-04-14). Everything here is live in the working tree on branch `RFID`. CHANGELOG entries `2.4.0` and `2.5.0` summarize the same work in release-note form; this doc focuses on the *why* and the cross-cutting design decisions.

---

## 1. Reports Module (generate/sign engine — REMOVED 2026-07-04)

> **REMOVED 2026-07-04.** The server-side report **generation + signing** engine
> (`modules/reports/`) and its **template-designer backend** (`modules/report-templates/`)
> were torn out as orphaned dead code — the frontend for both had already been removed
> 2026-06-08, and no active backend imported either module. Dropped: the 2 backend modules,
> 4 Prisma models (`ReportTemplate`, `ReportTemplateVersion`, `ReportInstance`,
> `ReportSignature`), 2 enums (`ReportTemplateStatus`, `ReportStatus`), 7 permissions,
> 7 reauth actions, 9 feature-privilege nodes, and 5 npm deps (`puppeteer-core`,
> `@napi-rs/canvas`, `chart.js`, `chartjs-adapter-date-fns`, `dayjs`). See the CHANGELOG
> "Reports (generate/sign) module tear-out" entry and `tasks/REMOVE-REPORTS-MODULE-PLAN.md`.
>
> **Not affected (still live):** the ad-hoc **report-reviews** submit/review/approve workflow
> (`modules/report-reviews/` + `ReportReview` model), the report-config defs
> (`report-page-titles` / `report-labels` / `report-signatories`), the `report-page-wrapper`
> print chrome, the `FilterLifecycleReportPage`, and the client-side cleaning-record /
> filter-lifecycle PDF **export** (re-gated onto the retained `REPORT_EXPORT` /
> `REPORT_GENERATE` perms via the now-configurable `cleaning_record.export` /
> `lifecycle.export` toggles). The live e-signature surface is `ReportReview` + the
> hash-chained `audit_trail` — never `ReportSignature` (which only the removed engine wrote).
>
> The historical architecture below is retained for the *why*.

Server-side report generation engine that resolves variable tags, renders HTML with charts, converts to PDF via Puppeteer, and serves downloadable reports.

### Schema + permissions
- **4 Prisma models**: `ReportTemplate`, `ReportTemplateVersion`, `ReportInstance`, `ReportSignature`
- **2 enums**: `ReportTemplateStatus`, `ReportStatus`
- **9 `REPORT_*` permissions**, **6 reauth actions**, **2 sidebar items** (`report-templates`, `reports`)
- **Status workflow**: `DRAFT → PENDING_SIGNATURE → SIGNED / REJECTED`
- **Storage**: PDFs at `uploads/reports/`, metadata in `ReportInstance` table

### Architecture
Single synchronous request-response pipeline:

```
parse template config
  → resolve {{tags}} via 5 data sources
    → build HTML with Handlebars
      → render charts as base64 PNG (chartjs-node-canvas)
        → generate PDF via Puppeteer
          → store to disk
            → return report instance
```

### Code structure
```
apps/api/src/modules/reports/
  report.service.ts          — orchestrator: generate, list, get, delete
  report.routes.ts           — 6 API endpoints
  variable-resolver.ts       — parse {{tags}}, dispatch to data sources
  data-sources/
    attribute-source.ts      — attr.$slot.field
    identifier-source.ts     — ident.$slot.type
    telemetry-source.ts      — ts.$slot.key[modifier]
    timestamp-source.ts      — time.now, time.range.*
    meta-source.ts           — meta.report/user/org.*
  renderers/
    html-builder.ts          — full HTML document
    chart-renderer.ts        — chartjs-node-canvas → base64 PNG
    pdf-renderer.ts          — Puppeteer HTML → PDF Buffer
    styles.ts                — CSS for PDF print layout
```

### Key behaviors
- **Visual template designer** — drag-and-drop layout editor with header / footer / section blocks
- **5 variable data sources** — attribute / identifier / telemetry / timestamp / meta
- **Digital signatures** — reports can be signed at generation time; signature metadata embedded in PDF + report instance
- **Synchronous generation** — single request-response (no BullMQ pipeline yet)
- **Frontend pages** — template list, template editor, report instance list, report viewer

Original design plan: `old/docs-superseded/superpowers-plans/2026-04-15-report-template-designer.md` and `2026-04-15-report-generation-engine.md`.

## 2. Offline Hardening — 14-issue overhaul

The Phase 3 offline implementation reconstructed pipeline logic client-side, leading to drift bugs. Phase 5 replaced the entire approach with **cache server responses verbatim, replay them via idempotent ops**.

### Foundation (commit `3c99973`)
- **TTL-based cache invalidation** — every cache entry has an explicit `expiresAt`; readers respect it
- **Idempotency keys** — every queued op carries `op-{uuid}`; server dedupes replays
- **Tombstones** — locally-deleted entities tracked separately so replay doesn't resurrect them
- **LRU eviction** — bounded cache size; oldest entries dropped on overflow
- **JWT refresh during replay** — queued ops can outlive their original token; replay path acquires a fresh token before retry

### In-code overhaul (commit `0c8de53`)
- **Stale-profile guard** — replay refuses to apply ops against a profile version that has changed; surfaces a yellow banner ("This filter's cleaning profile has changed since this cycle started") when `cycle.profile_id != live block-assignment`
- **Pre-cache on login** — full master-data hydration as soon as the user is authenticated (not lazy). Cached: cleaning-profile-assignment, active profiles, branding, field-ids, my-reauth-actions, approved block-change requests
- **Server-side `stageLookup`** — pre-computed per-stage `{nextStages, pendingChecklistProfileIds, leadsToEnd}` on `/current-state` response, so client doesn't need to walk the graph. Was: client walked the graph and missed chained CHECKLIST nodes (e.g. `WASH_IN → CHECKLIST_A → CHECKLIST_B → WASH_OUT` only saw `CHECKLIST_A`)
- **Filter-state cache TTL** raised 30 min → 24 h so long offline shifts don't invalidate cached cycle state

### Capacitor + APK (commit `b8e003e`)
- **Capacitor Network plugin** — replaces unreliable `navigator.onLine` on Android WebView
- **Service Worker hook** — backgrounded tab still triggers sync engine when device comes back online via SW `sync` event
- **APK rebuild** with the SW + Network plugin baked in

### Why this matters
Memory `feedback_offline_design.md` codifies the lesson: *never reconstruct server logic client-side*. The new architecture caches the full server response per filter (`filter-state-{id}`) and replays exact-state semantics. See `OFFLINE_SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full design.

## 3. RFID SDK Plugin in DigiLog APK (commit `39ccd1c`)

Before: KC-series UHF readers worked only via the standalone `rfid_scan_app/` Kotlin app (UKB-mode keyboard burst into the main APK).

After: `apps/android/android/app/src/main/java/.../RfidPlugin.java` wraps `Reader_Usb.jar` and exposes a Capacitor plugin to the web app. The DigiLog APK now supports **both** modes:

- **SDK mode** — direct USB SDK calls; works regardless of focused input
- **UKB mode** — keyboard-emulation fallback (with web-side guard via `use-rfid-guard.ts`)

UKB mode also fixed:
- **Zero-delay live tag display** — every keystroke now goes straight to the input (commits `bc8df22`, `f9721af`, `fd046fe`)
- **Burst threshold raised to 150 ms** — accommodates slower readers
- **On-screen debug overlay** for tag-scanning issues

---

## 4. Filter Data Management Console — 10 tabs mirror user pages

The data-management console at `/data/filters/:id` exposes filter-related rows from every relevant table. Phase 5 redesign principle: **each tab must render like its user-facing page**, not raw DB rows.

| Tab | Mirrors | Key columns |
|---|---|---|
| Retirements | `/filter-management/retirement` | retirement reason, date, performer |
| Replacements | `/filter-management/replacement` | replaced filter, replacement filter, date |
| Cleaning Cycles | `/cleaning-cycles/history` | profile, stage, status, performer |
| Filter Events | `/filter-traceability/:id` | event type, timestamp, performer, payload |
| Alarms | `/alarms` | severity, threshold, value |
| PM Entries | `/pm-schedules/:id` (detail card grid) | scheduled date, tolerance window, status |
| Audit Trail | `/audit` | actor, action, before/after diff |
| Notifications | `/notifications` | channel, status, payload |
| Admin Requests | `/admin-requests` | requester, type, status |
| Block Changes | `/approvals` | from-block, to-block, status |

### ⚠️ Compliance note (Super Admin escape hatch)
The Filter Data Mgmt console at `/config/filter-data-management` is a **SUPER_ADMIN-only** raw-edit surface:
- **All columns are inline-editable**, every record is deletable
- **Zero audit trail** — edits/deletes through this console produce **no audit entries** (deliberate; for emergency data fixes)
- **Unretire flow** — `_preRetireParentId` saved in `customAttributes` during retirement; unretire restores original parent AHU + deletes the replacement filter + removes all traces
- This bypasses the 21 CFR Part 11 audit-chain on purpose; access must be restricted to break-glass admins only.

Each tab also has an **Edit modal** matching the user-facing page's edit dialog.

Captured by memory `feedback_filter_data_mgmt_mirrors_pages.md`.

## 5. DRY_IN Two-Step Flow

DRY_IN was a single-event stage. Phase 5 split it into two steps for proper UX:

```
DRY_IN entry
  → SET_DURATION    — operator picks dryer minutes; cycle stays at DRY_IN
    → countdown panel renders (web + tablet + offline)
      → SUBMIT_READINGS — operator records temperature; cycle advances to DRY_OUT
```

### Implementation notes
- "Currently Drying" panel reads `dryerStartedAt` + `dryerDurationMinutes` from `filter-state-{id}` cache → renders even if the user navigates away and comes back, online or offline
- Selected-but-unsubmitted temperature persists in `dryer-temp-{id}` cache key
- Offline replay: server enforces SET_DURATION → SUBMIT_READINGS ordering; replay tolerates them as separate idempotent ops
- Cleaning-cycle history reads `dryerTemp` from the readings event for display

Original design plan: `old/docs-superseded/superpowers-plans/2026-04-17-dryin-state-persistence.md`.

---

## 6. Dynamic Backup / Restore

Old: explicitly-listed table names + manual JOIN code in the backup module. New entries to the schema were silently missed.

New (commit `15619be` / earlier): **iterate `pg_tables`** to enumerate every table, **`jsonb_populate_recordset`** to round-trip rows generically. Result:

- All **64 tables** covered automatically when a new model is added
- **Non-superuser compatible** — no `pg_dump` shell-out
- **Two-pass fixup for self-referencing rows** — first pass inserts with NULL self-refs, second pass updates them
- **SQL / CSV / JSON formats** all roundtrip `password_hash` (was previously stripped)

Captured by memory `project_dynamic_backup.md`.

---

## 7. Bloat Audit + Code Reorg (April 20–21)

`old/docs-superseded/bloat.md` is the full audit. Resolved in commits `15619be` / `8e9f244` / `251be95`:

- **P0.1 Submit-path parity** — extracted `validateAndQueue` helper; deleted ~200 LOC duplicate validation in `mobile-operations.tsx`
- **P0.3 `as any` budget** — lint rule blocks new occurrences; existing list shrunk
- **P1.1 Inline-style codemod** — added theme utility classes (`.text-theme-primary`, `.bg-theme-gradient`, etc.); replaced ~200 `style={{...}}` attributes
- **P2.3 Config monolith split** — `config/routes.ts` (1003 LOC, 40 endpoints) split into per-tab files
- **P2.4 Rotted comments removed** — `// removed: RolePrivilegesPage`, `// removed: SidebarConfigPage`
- **P3.1 Dependency drift fixed** — moved `jspdf`, `sanitize-html` to correct workspaces; removed dead `html5-qrcode`
- **EC2 / PM2 / Linux assets removed** — app is local-Windows-only; reduces drift between docs and reality

Outstanding from bloat.md (2 / 14): P0.2 monster-file split for `filter-list.tsx` (2433 LOC) and `rule-chains/editor.tsx` (2140 LOC).

---

## 8. Decision Tape Proposal (future architecture)

Captured by memory `project_decision_tape_proposal.md`. Goal: kill the recurring class of client/server pipeline drift bugs.

### Idea
Server emits an ordered "action tape" per filter — a sequence of permitted next actions with their parameters and validation rules. The client has **zero pipeline logic** — it just renders the tape and queues actions back.

```
GET /api/filters/:id/current-state
  → returns { state, actions: [{type, params, validations, ...}] }
  → tablet renders buttons/dialogs from `actions`
  → tablet POSTs back the chosen action; server validates against the same tape
```

### Benefits
- Pipeline rules live in **one place** (server)
- Replay is simply "did the action match a valid entry in the tape we cached?"
- Adding a new pipeline node type does not require a tablet release

### Status
Proposal only — not implemented. Current implementation still computes a `nextStages` array client-side (with `stageLookup` resolving the chain server-side as a stopgap).

## 9. Other Phase 5 work

### Filter CRUD + hierarchy edit/delete (session 04-18)
- **5 new permissions**: `FILTER_CREATE`, `FILTER_EDIT`, `FILTER_DELETE`, `FILTER_HIERARCHY_EDIT`, `FILTER_HIERARCHY_DELETE`
- **5 new reauth actions**: `CREATE_FILTER`, `EDIT_FILTER`, `DELETE_FILTER`, `EDIT_HIERARCHY_NODE`, `DELETE_HIERARCHY_NODE`
- "Create Filter" dialog next to "Bulk Upload"; Edit / Delete icons on filter rows; hover-reveal Edit / Delete on AHU + Area nodes in the hierarchy diagram
- **Block deletion** — Delete button on filter-list block cards (`ASSET_DELETE` + `DELETE_ASSET` reauth)

### Tablet access matrix (session 04-18)
- New SUPER_ADMIN-only config `/config/access-matrix` — per-module role allowlist; modules without an entry default to visible (back-compat)
- New tablet feature `rfid_assign` in `/config/tablet-access` — search/select filter, view tags with Remove, scan/type new tag, Assign Tag
- Mobile login enforces tablet-access feature list; rejects roles whose allowed list is non-empty but doesn't include `login`

### Backend RBAC plumbing (session 04-18)
- **`app.requireAnyPermission(...perms)`** decorator — accepts any of the listed perms with `_MANAGE`/`_VIEW→_READ` fallbacks
- **`enforceReauth(action, req, reply)`** extended to accept `string | string[]` — reauth if any configured for role
- Wired across granular toggles: equipment-groups, checklist-profiles, cleaning-profiles, PM schedules, filter ops, asset identifiers, bulk-upload

### Compliance + security hardening (sessions 04-20, 04-25)
- **Skip Block removed** for stages with `needsBlock: true` (WASH_IN, DRY_IN) — was setting `selectedBlock.id = null` and silently bypassing all block-change approval logic
- **Notification ownership check** — `assertNotificationVisible()` on mark-read / mark-unread / delete (was: any user could mutate any notification)
- **`enforceReauth('UPDATE_EMAIL_CONFIG' / 'UPDATE_SMS_CONFIG')`** added to notification-delivery routes
- **Org scoping on `getEvents` / `getCycles`** when `filterId` not specified — closes cross-tenant read leak for non-admin roles
- **Instrument readings stored with `leastCount`** so historical PDFs format numbers forever at the right precision

### Config cleanup (session 04-20)
- **4 dead config defs removed** — `offline-sync`, `rfid-scanner`, `role-privileges`, `sidebar-config`
- `cleanupDeadConfigKeys()` migration in `config-discovery.ts` removes stale DB rows on next API start
- Two nav cards removed from `config/index.tsx`
- **Merged `pm-schedule-settings` + `filter-pm-schedule`** — config-discovery one-time migration copies the old `enabled` into the merged config and deletes the old row

### UI / formatting polish (session 04-20)
- **Least-count number formatting** — `apps/web/src/lib/format-by-least-count.ts`: integer LC → `25`, 0.1 → `25.0`, 0.01 → `25.00`. Applied everywhere instrument readings render
- Login app-name gradient now uses `backgroundImage` + explicit `backgroundClip: text` (the shorthand `background` was wiping the clip)
- Dashboard welcome + stat-cards + quick-actions now use `var(--theme-gradient-from/to)` and `var(--theme-primary)` / `var(--theme-accent)`
- Equipment Groups save toast, Help content pre-fetch on edit, dynamic-config empty-dropdown label, AHU dashboard truncation warning at >1000 filters
- Dashboard-cards backend validation rejects unknown card keys with 400

### Folder renames (session 04-21, P1.4 from bloat audit)
- `routes/checklist/` → `routes/checklist-form/` (end-user submission)
- `routes/checklists/` → `routes/checklist-admin/` (admin CRUD for templates)
- URL routes unchanged; only import paths differ

### Handover artifacts (session 04-20)
- `PROJECT_HANDOVER/APPLICATION_FLOW.md` — concise overview with 14 Mermaid diagrams
- `PROJECT_HANDOVER/APPLICATION_FLOW.docx` — detailed Word doc
- `PROJECT_HANDOVER/APPLICATION_FLOW_OVERVIEW.docx` — summary
- `PROJECT_HANDOVER/convert-to-docx.mjs` regenerates docx from md (uses pandoc + `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`)

### CWH stuck cycles fix (session 04-25)
- 7 IN_PROGRESS cycles bound to obsolete `test` profile terminated via `scripts/reset-cwh-cycles.sql` (status=TERMINATED + asset_instances cleared)

### Backend offline-replay primitive (`apps/api/src/lib/idempotency.ts`)
- Server-side dedup for offline-replayed mutations
- Flow: client generates UUID → queues op locally with `clientOpId` → sync engine replays with `x-client-op-id: <uuid>` header + body field → server checks `FilterEvent.attributes.clientOpId` match → returns cached `current-state` response on duplicate
- Every mutation writer must persist `clientOpId` inside `FilterEvent.attributes` for the dedup to fire on retry
- Net result: offline replay is safe to retry without producing duplicate cycles, double advances, or repeat checklist submissions (foundation commit `3c99973`)

### `requireAnyPermission` decorator (session 04-18, `apps/api/src/plugins/rbac.ts`)
- `app.requireAnyPermission(...perms)` — accepts ANY of the listed perms (with `_MANAGE`/`_VIEW→_READ` fallbacks)
- Used for the granular toggle layer where two permission families satisfy the same route: e.g. equipment-groups accepts `ASSET_*` OR `EG_*`; checklist-profiles accepts `FCP_*` OR `CHECKLIST_*`; PM accepts `PM_READ/CREATE/UPDATE` OR `PM_DOWNLOAD_TEMPLATE/UPLOAD/EDIT_ENTRY/RESUBMIT`; filter ops accepts `FILTER_OPERATE` OR `FILTER_RETIRE/REPLACE`; bulk-upload accepts `ASSET_CREATE` OR `FILTER_BULK_UPLOAD`
- Paired with `enforceReauth(action, req, reply)` extended to accept `string | string[]` — reauth fires if any configured for the role

### Audit-template UUID hiding (session 04-18, `packages/shared/src/types/audit-templates.ts`)
- New `AUDIT_TEMPLATE_DEFINITIONS` system: registers per-action templates like `"<RequestType> — <Name> (<EmployeeID>)"` for `ADMIN_REQUEST_*` actions
- Audit Trail UI applies these templates so UUIDs no longer leak in the rendered name field
- New `audit-actions.ts` companion type lists every recognized audit action constant
- New `permission-categories.ts` groups perms for the role-access UI

### Production deployment artifacts (Windows)
- **`scripts/package-for-production.ps1`** — builds API (compiled JS) + Web (vite build) + shared package; bundles into `digilog-production.zip` ready for transport
- **`scripts/install-on-target.ps1`** — run-once installer on target Windows machine. After Phase 4 of the windows-friendly-rewrite (commits `127f25d..60d3c90` on `feature/phase4-tooling`): assumes only Node.js 20+ and PostgreSQL 18 + TimescaleDB are pre-installed (Memurai is optional, only for non-queue pub/sub; EMQX no longer needed — Phase 1 swapped to Mosquitto); invokes `install-mosquitto.ps1` automatically (step 3/9); enables `LongPathsEnabled` registry key; probes for `msedge.exe` and warns if missing (puppeteer-core uses Edge for PDF rendering); runs `npm ci --omit=dev`, `prisma generate`, `prisma migrate deploy`, `prisma db seed`; opens Windows Firewall ports 80/443/3000/1883. **Does NOT register a managed service** — the API is launched manually for smoke-test (`cd api; node dist/app.js`). The proper service-registration installer is Phase 5 work; see `DEPLOY-WINDOWS.md` § 7 for the NSSM stopgap.
- **`certs/`** — mkcert-generated TLS infrastructure for HTTPS API: `rootCA.pem` (install on tablet system cert store), `server.crt`/`server.key` (localhost), `ssl.conf` (OpenSSL config)
- **`tsdb-migration/init-hypertables.sql`** — TimescaleDB hypertable bootstrap; converts 5 PostgreSQL tables to hypertables with 7-day chunk_time_interval on `ts_telemetry`. Run once after `createdb digilog_tsdb`.

### Static-routes split (`apps/api/src/modules/config/static-routes/`, 11 files)
Bloat audit P2.3 follow-through. Each config tab gets its own `<surface>.routes.ts` file; top-level `routes.ts` is just a registration loop (~170 LOC, was 1003).

| File | Surface |
|---|---|
| `access-matrix.routes.ts` | `/config/access-matrix` |
| `action-reauth.routes.ts` | `/config/action-reauth` |
| `alarm-columns.routes.ts` | `/config/alarm-columns` |
| `audit-templates.routes.ts` | `/config/audit-templates` |
| `branding.routes.ts` | `/config/branding` (10 themes + logo) |
| `cleaning-profile-assignment.routes.ts` | `/config/cleaning-profile-assignment` |
| `dashboard-cards.routes.ts` | `/config/dashboard-cards` (rejects unknown card keys with 400) |
| `field-ids.routes.ts` | `/config/field-ids` |
| `roles.routes.ts` | `/config/role-access` |
| `tablet-access.routes.ts` | `/config/tablet-access` (+ `/my-features` endpoint for mobile login enforcement) |
| `user-id.routes.ts` | `/config/user-id` |

Adding a new config tab now requires: create `<surface>.routes.ts` + register it in `routes.ts` (one `await <surface>Routes(app)` line) + the existing 12 touchpoints from `feedback_config_sync.md`.

### PM QA Approval Workflow (session 04-13)
- Upload → entries land in `PENDING` state (SUPER_ADMIN auto-approves on upload)
- QA approves/rejects per-entry with mandatory remarks
- Rejected → user edits inline + resubmits
- Edit-after-approval → pending edit fields stored, old values stay active until QA re-approves
- `getDueTasks` only returns `APPROVED` entries — rejected/pending entries do not surface as due
- Schema: `PmEntryApprovalStatus` enum + 11 new columns on `PmScheduleEntry`
- New permission `PM_APPROVE`
- Config: `pm-schedule-approval` def with configurable `approvalRole`

### PM My Tasks system (session 04-11, hardened 04-13)
- CSV / XLSX bulk upload on PM Schedules page; rows = `(ahu_name, scheduled_date, tolerance_days)`
- **Past-date validation** (CSV only) — amber popup listing affected AHUs; user must click "Proceed Anyway"
- `GET /api/pm-schedules/due` returns entries in tolerance window + 30-day overdue horizon
- Desktop My Tasks at `/my-tasks`; Mobile My Tasks as a view inside `/m`
- **Per-AHU filter-set mode** (`/config/ahu-filter-set-config`) — 4 modes: `BOTH`, `SET_A`, `SET_B`, `DISABLED`; null `filterSet` filters included in BOTH only
- **PM auto-reason on mobile** — wash-in skips reason dialog when AHU has active PM window; `/current-state` returns `isPmDue` + `pmReasonKey`
- 21/21 audit tests passed (PM Schedules 7/7, Block Change 7/7, Filter Count 7/7) on 2026-04-13

### Visual Hierarchy Tree (session 04-13)
- Filters page List/Tree toggle
- Tree shows `Block → Area → AHU → Filter` with CSS connector lines
- Expandable/collapsible at each level
- Create buttons: `New Block`, `Add Area`, `Add AHU`
- Hover-reveal Edit / Delete on AHU + Area nodes (added 04-18)
- Create dialog renders dynamic fields from template `attributeSchema` (per `feedback_dynamic_template_fields`)
- Area template activated in DB

### RFID Tag Management on Filters Page (session 04-13)
- New RFID Tag column in the filter table
- RFID action button in each row's actions column
- Slide panel: view assigned tags, unassign, scan / type new tag
- `data-rfid="true"` attribute on the tag input — works with `use-rfid-guard.ts`
- Permissions: `ASSET_IDENTIFIER_CREATE` / `ASSET_IDENTIFIER_DELETE` (category: "RFID & Identifiers")

### Block Change Approval — implementation details (session 04-10..13)
- Trigger: filter belongs to Block A, user tries to clean in Block B → `/api/filters/:id/current-state?cleaningAreaId=B` returns `blockChangeStatus: 'REQUIRED'`
- Both desktop (`filter-operations.tsx`) and mobile (`mobile-operations.tsx`) show a "Request Block Change / Cancel" popup upfront
- Approved requests are **single-use**: status `APPROVED → EXPIRED` on cycle start
- Backend `AppError` sends `BLOCK_CHANGE_REQUIRED` (409) with structured `details: { filterId, homeBlockId, homeBlockName, requestedBlockId, requestedBlockName }`
- **Critical wiring**: `api-client.ts` line 58 maps `err.details ?? err.connectionInfo` — without this fix the popup never appeared
- Mobile approvals view requires comment input (added 04-13); remarks mandatory on all approval screens

### Configuration page restructure (session 04-13)
- General Settings (all admins): Password, DateTime, Backup
- Super Admin Settings: 22+ cards including new ones — RFID Scanner *(later removed as dead config)*, Offline Sync *(later removed as dead config)*, Cleaning Reasons, PM Schedule Settings, PM Schedule Approval, Block Change Approval, Filter Data Management, Tablet Access, Access Matrix, AHU Filter Set, Alarm Columns, Audit Templates, Cleaning Profile Assignment, Role Access
- Dynamic config modules section also SUPER_ADMIN-only

### Smaller items
- Forgot-password flow + show/hide password + lockout-progress UI on tablet (`a5fc98f`)
- Admin requests approval execution — approvals actually create/unlock/reset/modify users; requester Employee ID required; UUIDs hidden in audit (memory `project_admin_requests_flow`)
- Block-change request lifecycle — cross-block approval popup (desktop + mobile); single-use consumption; remarks mandatory (memory `project_block_change_approval`)
- PM "My Tasks" v1 — CSV bulk upload, `/api/pm-schedules/due`, expandable AHU cards, filter-set modes (memory `project_pm_my_tasks`)
- Capacitor online detection — poll `/api/health` every 15 s + on `visibilitychange` (memory `feedback_capacitor_online_detection`)
- className codemod merge rule — when replacing inline-style with className, merge into existing className attribute (memory `feedback_codemod_className_merge`)
- DateTime format support — DD-MM-YYYY in PM upload; PM upload upserts (no duplicates); admin-requests theme migrated indigo→cyan; bat-file errorlevel syntax fixed

## 10. Where to find historical design rationale

The completed feature plans live in `old/docs-superseded/superpowers-{plans,specs}/`. They contain problem statements, data models, validation logic, and API contract decisions that **are not duplicated in the code or CHANGELOG**:

| Feature | Spec / Plan |
|---|---|
| Block change approval | `superpowers-specs/2026-04-10-block-change-approval-design.md`, `superpowers-plans/2026-04-10-block-change-approval.md` |
| PM My Tasks | `superpowers-specs/2026-04-11-pm-schedule-my-tasks-design.md` |
| Report template designer | `superpowers-plans/2026-04-15-report-template-designer.md` |
| Report generation engine | `superpowers-plans/2026-04-15-report-generation-engine.md` |
| DRY_IN state persistence | `superpowers-plans/2026-04-17-dryin-state-persistence.md` |
| Bloat audit | `bloat.md` |

These were archived (not deleted) because the work is shipped — but the docs remain valuable when revisiting the *why*.

## 11. Outstanding work (carried forward from bloat audit)

- ~~**P0.2 — split monster files**~~ — Closed by **Wave 7** (2026-05-03): all 8 monster files decomposed into 78+ cohesive modules across 9 commits (`de54329`, `3b0346f`, `66cc80d`, `cfc78fb`, `7edacc1`, `e825e9b`, `26d61d0`, `4036336`, `4aa5a27`). Façade pattern throughout — every original file path keeps its public export so consumers (main.tsx lazy-loads + downstream imports) resolve unchanged. Web 84/84 + api 1202/1210 + shared 305/306 + tsc clean preserved exactly through every split. Each split commit message documents what stayed inline + why (handler/state coupling, prop-drilling cost > cohesion gain), surfaces pre-existing dead code or oddities for follow-up, and includes a drift-prevention note for the coordinated splits (filter-operations.tsx + mobile-operations.tsx share `apps/web/src/lib/filter-ops/` per `7edacc1`). Resulting orchestrators range 448-1633 LOC; the heaviest (filter-list.tsx at 1633) honors a deliberate decision not to drill 12+ props through a never-reused block selection grid + 15-prop table+pagination.
- **P3.2 — `.playwright-mcp/` accumulation policy** (gitignore + session-end cleanup hook)
- ~~**Decision tape** — design + prototype if pipeline drift recurs~~ — Closed by **Step 8 Phases 8.0–8.7** (2026-05-02 → 2026-05-03): server emits an ordered `actions[]` tape via `tape-generator.ts`; FE consumes via `actionsForStage()` / `getCurrentActions()` 3-tier resolver (server tape → local executor → cached); shared executor in `packages/shared/src/pipeline-executor/` runs the same 35 pure guards on both runtimes; `tapeVersion` staleness gate (409 STALE_TAPE) handles concurrent-operator collisions; `/api/sync/since` keeps the FE's local context current. Phase 8.7 cutover removed the legacy `nextAllowedStages` + `pendingChecklist` derived fields and the `TAPE_PARALLEL` flag — the action tape is now the only contract. Pipeline-walking drift between client and server is structurally impossible.
- ~~**Phase 2/3/4/5 manual test cases**~~ — Closed by **Wave 8a** (2026-05-03, commit `859492e3`): replaced markdown manual-test recipes with executable vitest e2e suites — `apps/api/src/e2e/{phase2-filter-operations,phase3-rfid-offline,phase4-perms-themes-reports,phase5-decision-tape-backup}.test.ts` (4 files, 29 new tests). Single-fork mode verification: 1202 → 1231 passing, zero regressions. Two pre-existing-bug flags surfaced for follow-up (PUT report-settings 404 — `hasCustomPage:true` skips dynamic-routes wiring; `/advance` `offlinePerformedAt` round-trip skipped because it needs full cycle seed).
- ~~**Multi-filter batch checklist dialog**~~ — Closed by **Wave 8a** (2026-05-03, commit `d660daf`): bug existed on BOTH desktop + mobile; fixed both with shared helper `findNextPendingChecklist` in `apps/web/src/lib/filter-ops/`. Each page tracks the unwalked-batch tail in a separate state (mobile: `pendingChecklistBatch`; desktop: `postAdvanceChecklistQueue`) so the existing `pendingBatch` shared-answer-set path stays byte-identical. After each `handleChecklistSubmit`, the page asks the helper for the next batch item with a pending gate. 7 new unit tests on the helper. 21 CFR Part 11 risk closed (filters B/C/... were silently skipping their CHECKLIST gates).
- ~~**Cleaning-profile version pinning in offline cache**~~ — Closed by **Phase A.2** (2026-05-01): `FilterCleaningProfile.lineageId UUID` + `@@unique([lineageId, version])` + index. Cycles already pin `profileId` to the exact archived row (rowful immutability). New endpoints `GET /api/filter-cleaning-profiles/:id/versions` and `/:id/versions/:n` expose history. Combined with Phase A.1's `ChecklistProfileVersion` + `cycle.checklistVersionPins`, both the cleaning-pipeline graph and the checklist questions are now version-frozen for any in-flight cycle.
- ~~**FilterProfile mapping has no version history**~~ — Closed by **Phase A.3** (2026-05-01): added `FilterProfile.version Int @default(1)` + new `FilterProfileVersion` sidecar (snapshot-then-bump on every `update()`). New endpoints `GET /api/filter-profiles/:id/versions` and `/:id/versions/:n`. Mirrors A.1 ChecklistProfile pattern (sidecar) rather than A.2 lineage pattern (rowful) because FilterProfile mutates in place and there's no pre-existing version column. Per-block override is explicitly out of scope — FilterProfile is uniform across all blocks. No cycle pinning needed since cycles already pin `cleaning_cycles.profileId` to a FilterCleaningProfile row at start. Model count 66 → 67. With A.1 + A.2 + A.3 closed, every mutable definition feeding a cleaning cycle now has byte-exact audit replay.
- ~~**EquipmentGroup admin-edit history**~~ — Closed by **Phase A.4** (2026-05-02): added `EquipmentGroup.version` + new `EquipmentGroupVersion` sidecar that snapshots the WHOLE composite (group row + all 3 instruments ordered by sortOrder) on every `update()`. New endpoints `GET /api/equipment-groups/:id/versions` and `/:id/versions/:n`. Operational drift on submitted readings was already covered by the immutable `FilterEvent.attributes.instrumentReadings` snapshot at submit time; A.4 adds the admin-side history. **Cleaning reasons** were NOT versioned — already drift-resistant via `CleaningCycle.cleaningReasonKey` + `cleaningReasonLabel` columns written at cycle start. Per-cycle group-version pinning intentionally deferred to a separate design call. Model count 67 → 68. **Phase 5b Path A is now complete** (A.1 + A.2 + A.3 + A.4).
- ~~**Per-cycle EquipmentGroup-version pinning** (the A.4-deferred design call)~~ — Closed by **P1** (2026-05-02): added `cleaning_cycles.equipmentGroupVersionPin Int?`. `startCycle()` and the reading-submit lazy-bind path stamp the live group's `version` onto the cycle. Reading validation (`filter-operations.service.ts:~1101`) reads `operatingMin/Max` from the pinned `EquipmentGroupVersion.snapshot.instruments[]` instead of the live row, with a fallback to the live row when the pin is null (legacy cycles) or the version row is missing (lazy first-version pattern). Audit replay is now byte-correct: a reading is validated against the rules in effect when the cycle started, regardless of subsequent admin edits. Tablet/offline app NOT updated — see `future/offline-version-sync-contract.md` for the Slice B follow-up bundled with the next APK build. P1 also fixed a latent pre-existing FK bug at `filter-operations.service.ts:877` (was storing FilterProfile id where FilterCleaningProfile id was expected; masked because every prior test went through config-based resolution).
- **Root working-tree noise** — test PNGs, `.playwright-mcp/`, `backups/` not gitignored (session 04-20 follow-up)

### N/A (no longer apply)
- **P2.1 — in-memory state migration to Redis** — closed N/A: app is local-Windows-only single-instance after EC2 removal (commit `251be95`); no horizontal-scaling concern.
- **P2.2 — BullMQ queue/worker connection factories** — done in session 04-21 (`getWorkerConnection()` per-call, `getQueueConnection()` singleton). Then superseded entirely by Phase 2 of windows-friendly-rewrite (commit `7832af1 chore(queue): drop BullMQ + Redis; graphile-worker is sole backend`) — no more queue connection factories at all, graphile-worker manages its own pool against the existing Postgres connection.

## 12. Windows-friendly rewrite (all phases complete + service launcher)

`docs/plans/2026-04-29-windows-friendly-rewrite.md` is a 5-phase plan to make the API run on bare Windows Server with no MSVC, no node-gyp, no paid Memurai, and no bundled Chromium. As of 2026-04-30 the explicit Phase 5+ open item (managed Windows-service launcher) has also landed. Status:

| Phase | Status | What landed |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Mosquitto MQTT swap | ✅ complete | `feature/phase1-mosquitto-rewrite` (commits `510f903..7d33dbf`) + service-bootable conf fix `0ecc151`. Replaces EMQX with Mosquitto 2.0 + a dynamic-security generator + `POST /api/internal/mqtt/refresh-acl`. Live e2e verified. |
| 2 — graphile-worker queue | ✅ complete | `feature/phase2-pg-queue` (cut-over `7832af1`). Drops BullMQ + ioredis + the Memurai dependency for queue work. graphile-worker on Postgres uses `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, `pg_advisory_lock`, JSONB payloads — all native PG18. |
| 3 — Reports Windows hardening | ✅ complete | `feature/phase3-reports-edge` (`79937b7..d72d44c`). `puppeteer` → `puppeteer-core` + Edge via `detectEdgePath()`; `chartjs-node-canvas` → `@napi-rs/canvas` (prebuilt N-API). Plus a major test-suite cleanup (`06bcb95`, `b2c3b37`) bringing apps/api Vitest sweep from 30 failed files / 65 failed tests down to 0 failed. |
| 4 — Tooling cleanup | ✅ complete | `feature/phase4-tooling` cut-over `127f25d..60d3c90` — `install-on-target.ps1` and `package-for-production.ps1` rewritten honest about the post-Phase-1+2+3 stack (Mosquitto, graphile-worker, puppeteer-core+Edge); `start-digilog.ps1`/`stop-digilog.ps1` shells dropped (referenced PM2 + EMQX); `.env.example` Mosquitto + graphile-worker block. Plus Phase 4 doc-sync `99ca7ad..c9d94a1` swept the operationally-load-bearing prose files. |
| 5.1 — Integration test | ✅ complete | `tests/integration/windows-server-stack.test.ts` (`INTEGRATION_TEST=1` gated) — full e2e suite: API boot + `/api/health`, MQTT publish 100 messages via in-process aedes broker → assert `ts_telemetry` rows, graphile-worker enqueue → handler fires within 15 s, PDF render → `%PDF-` magic bytes (commits `a51628d`, review-fix `24620c0`). |
| 5.2 — verify-windows-deployment.ps1 | ✅ complete | `scripts/verify-windows-deployment.ps1` — operator-facing 4-check smoke: `/api/health`, Mosquitto :1883, graphile-worker schema via psql, real PDF render via login → reports/generate. PS 5.1 + 7+ compatible (commits `b4ad539`, review-fix `ad07280`). |
| 5.3 — Phase 5 doc-sync sweep | ✅ complete | This commit's parent `29712d6` — closes the four files Phase 4 explicitly deferred (PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE diagram, API_REFERENCE EMQX prose, FRONTEND_GUIDE Nginx mention, OFFLINE_SYNC EMQX/Redis/63-models block) plus 30+ stale references across the rest of the active doc set + `future/` + `docs/` + `PROJECT_HANDOVER/`. |
| 5+ — Managed service launcher | ✅ complete | `scripts/install-services-phase5.ps1` + `scripts/uninstall-services-phase5.ps1` (commits added 2026-04-30) — registers `DigiLogAPI-Phase5` (`node apps/api/dist/app.js`, `DependOnService=postgresql-x64-18`) and `DigiLogWeb-Phase5` (`node apps/web/node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js preview --port 5175 --host`) as NSSM-managed Windows services with `Start=SERVICE_AUTO_START` (boot persistence), `AppExit Default = Restart` + `AppRestartDelay=3000` (auto-restart on crash), and 10 MB rotated stdout/stderr logs in `logs/`. ASCII-only PS so PS 5.1 tokenises correctly when invoked via `Start-Process`. Idempotent re-run (existing services stopped + removed first). Live verified: `Stop-Process` of the underlying `node` PID → NSSM auto-restarted within 3 s, service stayed `Running`. NSSM installed via `winget install NSSM.NSSM` and pinned in worktree-local `nssm-path.txt` (gitignored). |

`windows_dep` is the integration branch. Test pass-rate at end of Phase 3: `apps/api 1123/1123 + packages/shared 150/150 + packages/queue 6/6 = 1279/1279, all green`. Live e2e verified end-to-end (device → Mosquitto → API → graphile-worker → ts_pipeline_traces → reports/generate → 59 KB PDF with `%PDF-1.4` header).

The four `windowsIssues.md` 🔴 hard blockers (§1 Puppeteer, §2 chartjs-node-canvas, §3 EMQX, §7 Memurai) are all marked resolved with the commit hashes that closed them.
