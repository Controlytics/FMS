### Fixed — Quality Audit (30 issues resolved)

- **CRITICAL:** Auth double-throw for expired accounts
- **CRITICAL:** Config pages returning 404 (missing config definitions)
- **HIGH:** Organization scoping added to all filter-operations methods
- **HIGH:** Server-side checklist enforcement in advance() — prevents API bypass
- **HIGH:** bypass() now requires active cycle and validates target state
- **HIGH:** Permission guards on all 13 Phase 2 frontend routes
- **MEDIUM:** Race conditions in startCycle and submitChecklist (transactions + duplicate checks)
- **MEDIUM:** Cleaning profile update wrapped in transaction
- **MEDIUM:** Input sanitization (XSS) for remarks/justification fields
- **MEDIUM:** Pipeline validation (stateKeys, checklist profiles, graph connectivity)
- **MEDIUM:** getCycles performance (events opt-in via query param)
- **LOW:** 28 missing permissions added to ALL_PERMISSIONS
- **LOW:** Auth plugin role scope caching (30s TTL)
- **LOW:** ErrorBoundary dark theme, PM page navigation, node delete confirmation
