# 1. TypeScript compilation
cd apps/api && npm run build
cd apps/web && npm run build

# 2. Tests (1344 total, 0 failures)
npx turbo run test

# 3. Full Turborepo build (5 packages: shared, db, queue, api, web)
npm run build

# 4. Production deploy
pm2 restart digilog-api
```

## Architecture Principles

1. **Routes -> Services -> Repositories** — Thin route handlers, business logic in services, DB queries in repositories
2. **RequestContext** — Services receive `{ userId, userSub, userRole, ipAddress, userAgent, sessionId }` instead of Fastify request
3. **AppError hierarchy** — `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`, `ConflictError`, `ForbiddenError` caught by global error handler
4. **Reauth in routes** — `enforceReauth()` needs `req`/`reply`, called before service layer
5. **Swagger schemas in routes** — Define the HTTP contract at the route level
6. **Audit logging in services** — Services call standalone `auditLog()` with `RequestContext`
7. **Shared package as source of truth** — All Zod schemas, types, constants live in `@digilog/shared`
8. **Light theme only** — bg-white, text-slate-800, bg-slate-50 sections, no dark mode
