/**
 * Conditional global setup for the windows-server-stack integration suite.
 *
 * When INTEGRATION_TEST !== '1' the suite as a whole is `describe.skipIf`'d
 * and we MUST NOT touch the DB — otherwise running the workspace on a box
 * that lacks Postgres / Mosquitto explodes during setup before any test gets
 * to skip itself. In that case this hook is a no-op.
 *
 * When the gate is on, we delegate to the API's globalSetup so the tests
 * inherit the same idempotent SUPER_ADMIN/`admin` fixture the e2e suite
 * uses (vitest.global-setup.ts in apps/api/).
