/**
 * Centralized timing constants for the offline pipeline.
 *
 * Why these live here: the cleanup that flushed inline `setTimeout(.., 2000)`
 * and `setInterval(.., 30_000)` calls into named exports. Future tuning of
 * sync cadence, connectivity probe frequency, or blocker re-evaluation
 * happens in one place — and if/when these become SUPER_ADMIN-configurable
 * (similar to the W1 offline-cache config), the read-from-runtime mechanism
 * has one obvious hook.
 *
 * Naming: each constant is suffixed `_MS` so the unit is unmistakable at
 * the call site (`setInterval(tick, CONNECTIVITY_POLL_INTERVAL_MS)` reads
 * better than `setInterval(tick, 15_000)`).
