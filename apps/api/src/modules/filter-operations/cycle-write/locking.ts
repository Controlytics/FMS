/**
 * Filter Operations — shared row-lock helper for the 4 write methods.
 *
 * Phase 5b.4 introduced a SELECT FOR UPDATE on filter_details to serialize
 * advance/bypass/terminate against concurrent writes on the same filter.
 * Phase 8.7 audit (AUDIT-2026-05-02-concurrent-operator.md) added the
 * CYCLE_CHANGED recheck to the same lock — every cycle-mutating write now
 * uses an identical shape:
 *
 *   1. SELECT current_lifecycle_state, current_cycle_id
 *      FROM filter_details WHERE ... FOR UPDATE
 *   2. If lockedFD.current_lifecycle_state !== expectedState -> 409 STATE_CHANGED
 *   3. If lockedFD.current_cycle_id      !== expectedCycleId -> 409 CYCLE_CHANGED
 *
 * Extracted as a shared helper so the three writers stay in lockstep when
 * the lock semantics get audited again. submitChecklist's lock is a
 * different shape (SELECT 1, ALREADY_SUBMITTED guard against filter_event)
 * and stays inline in submit-checklist.ts.
