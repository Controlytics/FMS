/**
 * Stage Approvals service — the approver side of the cleaning stage interlock.
 *
 * A CleaningStageApproval is created (PENDING) by the operator's advance INTO an
 * interlock stage (see filter-operations/advance.ts). Here the configured
 * approver re-authenticates (the digital signature) and either:
 *   - APPROVE → the operator is released to continue per the cleaning-profile graph.
 *   - REJECT  → the filter's currentLifecycleState moves back (WASH_OUT→WASH_IN,
 *               DRY_OUT→DRY_IN); a deviation FilterEvent is logged; for a DRY_OUT
 *               reject the cycle's dryer fields are cleared so the operator must
 *               actually re-dry. The operator re-cleans and a fresh PENDING is
 *               raised when they re-reach the gated stage.
 *
 * Guards (per locked decisions 2026-06-12):
 *   - role match: decider's role === the approval's frozen approverRole (SUPER_ADMIN
 *     always allowed).
 *   - segregation of duties (config requireDifferentApprover): the operator who
 *     performed the stage cannot sign their own approval.
 *
 * The reauth password check is the digital signature; it happens in routes.ts via
 * enforceReauthAlways before these methods run.
