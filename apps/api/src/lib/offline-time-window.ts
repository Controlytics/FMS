/**
 * offlinePerformedAt validator — audit 2026-05-04 fix (api-supporting C2).
 *
 * The tablet's wall clock IS the source of truth for the timestamp on offline
 * actions — that's the entire point of offline operation: the audit trail must
 * record when the operator physically performed the action, not when the
 * server received the replay (which can be hours or days later).
 *
 * However, the prior implementation accepted ANY value the client sent. A
 * malicious or compromised client could:
 *   - back-date forged actions arbitrarily far in the past
 *   - forward-date actions to bypass time-bounded business rules
 *   - replay an action with an offlinePerformedAt that predates the cycle's
 *     own start time (logically impossible but accepted)
 *
 * Combined with the unauthenticated `x-offline-replay: true` header bypass
 * (api-core C1, api-supporting C1), this gave any authenticated party the
 * ability to forge audit records with arbitrary timestamps and have the
 * system accept them as authoritative.
 *
 * Constraints enforced here (all validations are CHEAP — pure date math):
 *   1. Future skew: max 5 minutes ahead of server clock (allows for tablet
 *      clock drift + replay latency, rejects deliberate forward-dating).
 *   2. Maximum staleness: 30 days. A tablet that has been offline for more
 *      than a month should not be silently accepted; operator should
 *      re-perform the action against current state.
 *   3. Cycle-start floor (where applicable): offlinePerformedAt cannot be
 *      earlier than the cycle's startedAt — checked by callers that have
 *      cycle context.
 *   4. Only accepted with the offline-replay header (the entire flow assumes
 *      this is a replay; without the header, the server records its own clock).
 *
 * `OfflineTimeError` carries a stable code so the FE can surface the right
 * remediation message.
