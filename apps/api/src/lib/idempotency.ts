/**
 * Idempotency helper — dedup retried offline replays via x-client-op-id header.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Client queues an operation locally with a generated UUID (clientOpId)
 *   2. Sync engine replays with header `x-client-op-id: <uuid>` + body `clientOpId`
 *   3. Server checks if any FilterEvent was previously written with this clientOpId
 *      stored inside attributes.clientOpId — if so, returns the cached current-state
 *      response (effectively a no-op replay)
 *   4. Otherwise the mutation proceeds, and the writer must persist clientOpId
 *      inside FilterEvent.attributes so a future retry will hit step 3
 *
 * This makes every offline replay safe to retry without producing duplicate cycles,
 * double advances, or repeat checklist submissions.
